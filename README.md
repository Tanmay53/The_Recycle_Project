## The Recycle Casts

We can make Podcasts and Videos by talking and interacting with the People involved in the Recycling Industry and sharing it with the world.

### Where should we start with?

### What should we ask?

 * What inspired you to venture into recyling industry?
 * What was the most challenging part of setting up a recyling plant?
 * The Central and the State Government do show their interests towards encouraging recycling? But when it comes to Local Governing bodies, do they also share the smae interest and do they help in forwarding of benefits which come from the Centre and the State?
 * Demand of the Product and Supply of the Raw Materials are decisive factors for any industry. Please throw some light on how these factors have been in your case?
 * Currently, the mojor contributors to the recyling industry are poor people. These people have to work as free-lancers and in very unhygenic condition. Do you see a shift in the method of getting the raw material to become organized and socially recognized in the near future?
 * There is a wide range of platics, ranging from LDPE to HDPE, Polycarbonates to Thermosetting, Styrofoam to PVC an so on. Which one among these is currently not recyled on scale and you think that it may have huge potential in the future?
